# Search and Command Palette

The palette is a typed, in-browser navigator over the app's existing URL state. It does not send queries to a service and should remain deterministic: structured intents rank first, indexed destinations rank next, and low-confidence matches stay visible for the user to choose instead of auto-executing.

## Supported grammar

- Owner and season: `Joe 2021`, `2021 Joe`, `Shap 2024 playoffs`
- Rivalry: `Zubs vs Joel`, `Joe versus Shap`, `Nuss against Rishi`
- Season and game type: `2024 playoffs`, `2024 Saunders`, `2019 regular season`
- Score threshold: `150 point games`, `games over 140`, `Joe 100 or less`
- Records and filters: `biggest loss`, `Joe biggest loss`, `highest score`, `Joe losses`
- Features: `current season`, `playoff picture`, `Joe trophy case`, `Joe dynasty`, `historical matchup`
- Owner Hub: exact canonical owners (`Joe`), exact current display/team aliases, `Joe owner hub`, `my team`
- Transactions: `transactions`, `trade desk`, `waiver wire`, `player journeys`, `owner activity`, `draft and keepers`, `Joe moves`
- Draft Spot: `draft spot`, `pick 10`, `late draft picks`, `Joe draft history`
- Commands: `dark mode`, `light mode`, `system theme`, `export history`

Canonical owner names come from league assets. Sleeper display and team names in `CurrentSeason.json` are added as aliases when present, but generated URLs always use the canonical owner.
An exact owner or alias produces that owner's explicit Owner Hub URL as the first result, ahead of owner-season History. Running the result does not save or change My Team. Owner-scoped move results use `tab=transactions&txView=owners&txOwner=<canonical owner>` and do not hydrate `TransactionHistory.json` while search is ranking.

## Extension path

1. Add or refine normalization in `src/search/search-normalize.ts`.
2. Add the high-confidence phrase rule and typed intent in `src/search/search-intents.ts` and `src/search/search-types.ts`.
3. Resolve the intent to URL state or a local command in `src/search/search-actions.ts`.
4. Add persistent destinations to `src/search/search-index.ts` so recents survive reloads.
5. Cover the phrase and resulting URL in `test/ui/app.spec.js`. Add URL validation to `test/state-helpers.test.js` when new state is introduced.

Do not put raw query text in URLs or local storage. Do not add an external search dependency unless real query fixtures demonstrate a ranking problem the current token and subsequence scorer cannot solve.

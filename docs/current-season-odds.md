# Current Season probability model

The Current Season command center keeps deterministic standings, clinched/eliminated status, and configured tiebreakers authoritative. Probabilities are a separate estimate layer and are not part of the default finalized-season recap.

## Lifecycle gate

`src/data/season-presentation.ts` owns the six presentation phases and the single odds eligibility decision. The probability module is requested only for a regular-season `command` or `standings` view.

| Phase/view | Probability work |
| --- | --- |
| Regular-season command or standings | Eligible; load on demand |
| Preseason recap | Not requested |
| Postseason command | Not requested; trophy paths use deterministic game state |
| Finalizing or offseason recap | Not requested |
| Historical fallback | Not requested |
| Matchups, owners, or recap view in any phase | Not requested |

An explicit command view for a finalized season exposes historical/final analysis, but its projection mode is completed-only and it does not calculate future odds.

## Model contract

- Model version: `team-score-monte-carlo-v1`.
- Default run count: 10,000.
- Seed: data version, season, selected week, model version, and the current game-score snapshot.
- Outputs: playoff, bye, every seed, and Last place probabilities for each active owner.
- Additional snapshots: matching pre-week baseline, if-current-scores-hold, and selected-owner win/loss scenarios.
- Historical week selection truncates the analyzed snapshot after that week, so movement always compares post-week N with pre-week N.
- Historical records, seeds, statuses, gaps, and probabilities share that same post-week snapshot, while playoff/byes/Last place slots are inferred from the selected season's stored bracket.
- Forced win/loss scenarios condition normally sampled matchup scores and preserve live scores as hard floors.

## Team scoring distributions

Completed regular-season scores in the selected season receive increasing weight from 40% early in the year toward 85% late in the regular season. Recency-weighted historical owner seasons supply the next prior, and league scoring supplies the remaining weight or the full fallback for expansion/missing-history owners.

Means and standard deviations are blended, standard deviation has a defensive minimum, and samples are clamped to historical league bounds. The UI exposes current/historical sample counts and weights through the model contract and describes the methodology beside the odds.

## Live games

When `CurrentSeason.update_context.contains_live_scores` is true, the model is score-aware: the current score acts as a floor and is blended with team strength. The model is explicitly not lineup-projection-aware because the asset does not contain remaining-player projections or reliable completion metadata.

When live scores are not declared reliable, simulations use pregame team strength. “If scores hold” finalizes available live scores and simulates only later games.

## Invariants

- A fixed seed and snapshot produce identical output.
- Seed probabilities for one owner sum to 100%.
- League playoff probabilities sum to the configured playoff slots.
- League bye probabilities sum to the configured bye slots.
- Last place probabilities sum to the configured Last place slots.
- Completed-season results collapse to exact 0%/100% probabilities.
- Clinched and eliminated mathematical states override estimates in the presentation layer.

The engine loads only when an eligible active Current Season view is rendered. Finalized 2025 therefore reaches ready state without requesting the odds module or probability methodology.
